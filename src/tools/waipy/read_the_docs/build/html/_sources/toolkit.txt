How can anyone turn a 1D to 2D information?
The code will explain to you!

The code is structed in two scripts:

- lib_wavelet.py : python's functions library

- wavetest.py    : call functions and plot

    The Morlet wavelet is used as default in this code.


Building the puzzle ...


1. You have to choose the wavelet function
------------------------------------------


To be called a wavelet, the function (psi) has to satisfy the admissibility condition:

- "\ (...) for an integrable function, means that its average should be zero" (Farge, 1992).

-  Wavelet function must have energy equal to one. "\This ensures that the wavelet function has compact support(e-folding time),ensuring spatial location."(Domingues *et al*, 2012).

The most popular wavelet function was created by Jean Morlet in 1980, a French research scientist working on seismic data analysis (Farge, 1992),whose complex function satisfied the *Heseinberg-type equality*. This means the Morlet wavelet allows to analyze the phase and modulus of the decomposed signal (Domingues *et al*, 2012) and localized time and frequency in the same extent.

In the following, the Morlet wavelet equation proposed by Torrence and Compo (1998) -  a plane wave modulated by Gaussian envelope of unit width (Farge, 1992) - Morlet wavelet: 

.. math::

	\psi_{0}(\eta) = \pi^{-1/4} e^{i\omega_{0}\eta} e^{-\eta^2/2} 

   
Where:
        \omega_{0}          : nondimensional frequency - time/scale resolution is adjust by this param (Maraun and Kurths, 2004)

        \eta 	            : nondimensional parameter of time
        


The wavelet scale and the Fourier frequency are not direct reciprocals of each other, so, one has to rescale the result of wavelet analysis with a factor depending on the mother wavelet (Maraun and Kurths, 2004). The normalization for Morlet wavelet (Torrence and Compo, 1998; Maraun and Kurths, 2004):

.. math::
   
 	1/f = 4\pi s / (\omega_{0} + \sqrt{2+\omega_{0}^2})

The Morlet wavelet is only marginally admissible (zero average),so some small correction terms are added (Farge, 1992).In practice, for omega0 (k0 in the code) = 6, s.f = 1 (Maraun and Kurths, 2004). 
 

2. Compute wavelet power spectrum
